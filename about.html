					<h1>Our People are Our Strength</h1>
					<br />
					<p>Vantage Shipbrokers Pte Ltd was formed in April, 2012 to provide ship broking services to the tanker markets. The company was the brain child of a group like-minded experienced brokers who wished to branch out on their own.</p>
					<p>From the inception (unlike small start-ups) commenced operation with a team of over 20 members specializing in chemicals/dirty petroleum products/clean petroleum products.</p>
					<p>As of the end of June 2017, Vantage Shipbrokers employs over 35 people with aspirations to grow further to encompass liquid carriage of goods.</p>
